# n8n Workflows Collection

This repository is a collection of powerful, ready-to-use workflows for the low-code automation platform [n8n.io](https://n8n.io/). Each project is included as a submodule and contains its own detailed documentation.

These workflows demonstrate how to automate complex processes, integrating various APIs and AI services to minimize manual work and increase efficiency.
